## The Nuts and Bolts of Machine Learning

<ins>The different types of Machine Learning</ins>

  - Supervised Machine Learning: Uses labeled datasets to train algorithms to classify or predict outcomes.

To summarize, supervised machine learning algorithms use data with answers already in it, and use it to make more answers either by categorizing or by
estimating future data.

  - Unsupervised Machine Learning: Uses algorithms to analyze and cluster unlabeled datasets.

There are a couple of other types of machine learning besides supervised and unsupervised, like **Reinforcement Learning** or **Deep Learning**.

ML and AI refer to the same principle; training a computer to detect patterns in data without being explicitly
programmed to do so.

Supervised learning models that make predictions that are on a continuum are called **regression algorithms**.

    Continuous variables: Variables that can take on an infinite and uncountable set of values.
    Categorical variables: Variables that contain a finite number of groups or categories.
    Discrete features: Features with a countable number of values between any two values.

Discrete variables are able to be counted, and categorical variables are able to be grouped.

Knowing what type of features you have in a dataset, and what outcomes you're looking for, will help you to determine the most applicable ML model.

  - Recommendation Systems: Unsupervised learning techniques that use unlabeled data to offer relevant suggestions to users. The main goal of a
Recommendation System is to quantify how similar one thing is to another.

One approach used by Recommendation Systems is Content-based filtering, where comparisons are made based on attributes of content.

Another one is, Collaborative filtering, where comparisons are made based on who else liked the content (the Recommendation System doesn't need to 
know anything about the content itself).

Natural Language Processing, or NLP, could be used too (document-term matrix: A mathematical matrix that describes the frequency of terms that occur 
in each document in a collection.)

  - Integrated Development Environment (IDE): A piece of software that has an interface to write, run, and test a piece of code.

The two main types of Python files are known as Python scripts and Python notebooks.

    Python scripts are better for production-grade code, and are easier to debug and manage.

    Python notebooks are better for exploratory analyses, presentations, or anything that needs to be human-facing. You are
    able to insert images, text, and links directly into the code.
