## The Nuts and Bolts of Machine Learning

<ins>The main types of Machine Learning</ins>

  - Supervised Machine Learning: Uses labeled datasets to train algorithms to classify or predict outcomes.

To summarize, supervised machine learning algorithms use data with answers already in it, and use it to make more answers either by categorizing or by
estimating future data.

  - Unsupervised Machine Learning: Uses algorithms to analyze and cluster unlabeled datasets.

There are a couple of other types of machine learning besides supervised and unsupervised, like Reinforcement Learning or Deep Learning.

ML and AI refer to the same principle; training a computer to detect patterns in data without being explicitly
programmed to do so.

Supervised learning models that make predictions that are on a continuum are called **regression algorithms**.

  Continuous variables: Variables that can take on an infinite and uncountable set of values.
  Categorical variables: Variables that contain a finite number of groups or categories.
  Discrete features: Features with a countable number of values between any two values.

Discrete variables are able to be counted, and categorical variables are able to be grouped.

Knowing what type of features you have in a dataset, and what outcomes you're looking for, will help you to determine the most applicable ML model.
